For as long as he's been developing in Salesforce,
Simon Law <slaw@quantast.com> wanted an Apex Linter.

After his colleague Scott Posey <sposey@quancast.com>
wrote PR checkers for SObject Map keys and @future in tests
using a simple bash script that used regular expressions,
Simon decided to move the technique 
into Python to improve error messages
and make it easier to add new validators.

We welcome additions to this suite.
